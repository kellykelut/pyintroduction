#Variables Practice


#String
# a word that need " " to be printed out
# can save in the variable which can be used again.
# example
greeting = "hello"
print(greeting)
len(greeting) 

#Number
a = 10

# type() is the built in function that will give the type of the variable.
# for example type(greeting) -> str or string

#String
character = "Jon Snow"
print(character)
len(character) // get the length of the word
print("HELL0", "h")

#Number
price = 10
print(price)

#Math Operator

x = 1
y = 2
z = 3
productvalue = ((x*y)**z)/8
print(productvalue)

#built in function
int(10.5) -> 10
round(10.6) -> 11
int("100") + 100 -> 200

#Sum calculation
a = 1.0
b = 2
sum = int(a + b)
print(sum)

#Lists
#list is the variable that hold or store the same data type in the list.
name = ["putri", "ali", "abu"]
print(name[2]) -> "abu" // the indexing starts from 0,1,2, ...

mylist = ["well","good", "to", "know", "you"]
print(mylist)

#List indexing and slicing
#can access the list from the back starting with -1
#for example
print(mylist[-1]) -> "you"

print(mylist[0:2]) // it will print from index 0 until less than 2 -> "well", "good"
print(mylist[0:] // it will print everything
print(mylist[-2:-1] // since Python cannot read from right to left so cannot do this -1:-2

#insert the index of character'h' 

nameq = "John"
print(nameq[2])
print(nameq[-2])

nameq = "John Smith"
print(nameq[2:4])

letter = "abc.......xyz" // get the index of "y"
print(letter[-2])

#there are many funcion we can use to list such as remove(), append(), sort()

name.append("atikah") -> "putri", "ali", "abu", "atikah"
name.remove("putri") -> "ali", "abu", "atikah"

#remove item using index
name.pop(1) -> ali", "atikah"

#print("Python is fun"[-3:][-1])
#We're dealing with two consecutive slicings here. The first one extracts the string 'fun'
#from string 'Python is fun' while the second extracts string 'n' from string 'fun'.

#append to list. add "ali" to the list
mylist = ["jack", abu"]
mylist.append("ali")

#append list to list
list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = [2]
list2.append(list1[-1])

#Tuple is also like lists but rarely used since its mutable

#dictionary. its  a key pair value key:value
pins = {"Mike" : 1234,"John":2222}
print(pins("Mike")) -> 1234

Mapping two lists to a dictionary:
 keys = ["a", "b", "c"] 
 values = [1, 2, 3] 
 mydict = dict(zip(keys, values)) 
 mydict 
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

#User input 
#it will suspend the program and waiting the input from the user
